# Digital Clock

This project is a simple digital clock display built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Description

The digital clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The time is updated every second to ensure it stays in sync with the system time.

## Implementation

The clock is implemented using basic HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The HTML file contains a `div` element with an id of `clock`. This `div` is where the time will be displayed.

The CSS file contains styling for the `body` and `#clock` to center the clock on the page and give it a digital aesthetic.

The JavaScript file contains a function `updateClock` that gets the current date and time using the `Date` object, extracts the hours, minutes, and seconds, and then updates the `innerHTML` of the `#clock` div.

## Usage

To use this digital clock, simply open the HTML file in any web browser. The time will start automatically.
